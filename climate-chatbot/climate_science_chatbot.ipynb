Weather is what you experience on a day-to-day basis, and it can change from hour to hour, day to day, or week to week. Weather patterns are influenced by various factors, such as the movement of high and low-pressure systems, fronts, and wind patterns.\\n\\n**Climate**, on the other hand, refers to the long-term average atmospheric conditions in a particular region or globally. Climate describes the average temperature, precipitation, and other weather patterns over a period of years, decades, or even centuries. Climate is a more stable and persistent phenomenon than weather, and it\\'s influenced by factors such as the Earth\\'s orbit, volcanic eruptions, and human activities like greenhouse gas emissions.\\n\\nTo illustrate the difference, consider this analogy:\\n\\nWeather is like a person\\'s mood, which can change from day to day. Climate is like a person\\'s personality, which remains relatively consistent over time.\\n\\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) defines climate as \"the average atmospheric conditions in a particular region, including temperature, humidity, cloudiness, wind, precipitation, and other meteorological elements, over a specified period, usually 30 years or more.\"\\n\\nIn summary, weather refers to short-term, local conditions, while climate refers to long-term, regional or global patterns. Understanding the difference between weather and climate is essential for grasping the complexities of climate change and its impacts on our planet.\\n\\nSource:\\n* Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
